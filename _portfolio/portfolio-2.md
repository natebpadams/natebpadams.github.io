A science talk with a difference. Combining gravity defying stunts on aerial silk and rope, interactive demonstrations with the audience and live maths, this is something completely new.

Sadly only performed a few times before the pandemic and lockdown hit. I'm looking forward to one day being being able to do silly things in front of an audience again.
