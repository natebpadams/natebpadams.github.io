‘Space Plague’, is a co-designed experience working with multiple partners to which brings together elements of live action role playing, ethics, escape rooms and hands on experiments to under served communities.

During the development of 'Space Plague' phases 1 and 2, I was a science content producer, developing the overarching story with the production team, designing the audience experience and creating bespoke interactive activities for several of the theatrical zones.  During production I acted the role of harassed medic, leading audiences through differential diagnosis and epidemiology activities.
