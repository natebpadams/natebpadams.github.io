Four acts, four different interpretations of biochemical research, each written and devised by Sheffield circus artists. From the ‘Scales to Photosynthesis’ with Samrara Casewell to ‘How to Seduce a Magnesium Ion’ by Claire Crook via some death defying ‘Protein-Protein Interaction’ from Rebecca Solomon and Jess Abouzeid, and 'How to Make a Protein' with Dr Nate Adams, witness incredible feats of human athleticism, flexibility and endurance as we tell the a story of life inside cells.
