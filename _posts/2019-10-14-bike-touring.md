I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time over the last few years cycle touring. Most of the time I&#8217;m with my husband exploring, but I also did my epic solo trip down the West Coast of America in 2018. It&#8217;s a different kind of &#8216;slow&#8217; tourism. You get to smell the countryside. 

A few people have asked for a &#8216;list&#8217; of what our gear is, and when I was starting out, it was difficult to find exhaustive list &#8211; everyone has their own style, and I cribbed things from other people. Hopefully this will be helpful for those getting into touring. It&#8217;s the best. 

## The bike!

The most important part I suppose. There is loads of advice out there, steel, aluminium, mixes of both. After a lot of deliberation I went for the [Tour de Fer 10](https://www.genesisbikes.co.uk/bike/tour-de-fer-10), in a medium frame. I called her Betty (I&#8217;m not sure why). Everyone has their own priorities. Strength, weight, riding position etc. I tried out a few till I was happy.

## Essential Gear

### Panniers

I&#8217;ve got Ortleib [City Rollers](https://www.ortlieb.com/uk/back-roller-city) at the rear, and [Roller Classic](https://www.ortlieb.com/uk/sport-roller-classic) bags on the front rack, and I have a small Ortlieb Front bag for energy bars and maps.

### Tent

The [MSR Tour 2](https://www.msrgear.com/ie/products/tents/hubba-tour-2-two-person-cycle-touring-tent/09550.html?srd=true) is fantastic. Lightweight, and brilliant for 1 or 2 people. It has a porch so you can cook when it&#8217;s bucketing it down outside.  

### Sleeping Bags

We use 3 Season ones, and pack a silk liner if we think it&#8217;s going to get mega cold.

### Pillows

Inflatable pillows like [these ones](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/helium-trek-pillow-grey-id_8382813.html) from Decathlon are a life saver. 

### Air Bed

I love my [Exped synmat mattress.](http://www.exped.com/switzerland/en/product-category/mats/synmat-ul-lw) 

### Stove and Gas

We haven&#8217;t been anywhere off the beaten track where we would need anything too complex. Our little [Vango stove](https://www.vango.co.uk/gb/outdoor-trekking-essentials/437-compact-gas-stove.html) works extremely well, and you can buy gas at any outdoor store.

### Repair kit

  * Spare pump
  * CO2 pump (life saver)
  * Spare inner tubes
  * Puncture repair kit
  * Chain Repair kit
  * Allen Keys
  * Leatherman
  * First Aid kit

### Bike Lock

I&#8217;ve got a medium weight [Abus Steel-O-Flex](https://www.abus.com/uk/Mobile-Security/Bike-Safety-and-Security/Locks/Steel-O-Flex) lock, which has travelled many miles with me so far.

## Camp Life

### Cookware and Silverwear

Having tested a few things, I&#8217;ve decided [Trangier](https://trangia.se/en/) is the best.  I&#8217;ve got $3 knife from Walmart, a tiny spatula, a mini chopping board and a set of plastic camping cutlery have done me fine.

### Coffee!

Vital! We started off with the 3-in-1 sachets &#8211; but over time the overly sweet instant coffee sachets got too sickly. These days we use an [Aeropress](https://www.aeropress.co.uk) and it makes such a difference! 

### Sponge and suds

I cut a kitchen sponge in half. For detergent, I clean out an old hand sanitiser bottle and fill it with dish soap. I&#8217;m now going to pack a kitchen towel to dry things off.

### Chair

Another amazing purchase you don&#8217;t realise is so important. In Europe where they don&#8217;t really provide picnic tables, our [Helinox Chairs](https://helinox.com/products/chair-one?variant=16668545581126#Image5322740072518) are AMAZING.

### Sleeping Mask and Ear Plugs

Surprisingly useful, especially when camping next to cement factories or railway lines. 

### Toiletries and Towel

Pack light. But you&#8217;re exposed to the elements a lot so sunscreen and moisturiser are in my pack, along with medications, soap, anti-chafe cream, toothpaste, shaver etc.

# Clothes

This is a personal list, after lots of trial and error, and the fact that I don&#8217;t mind getting a bit gross, as long as I can have a shower at the end of the day!

## Cycle gear

  * 1-2 pairs of Bib shorts
  * 2 Cycle T-shirts
  * 2 pairs of socks
  * Baselayer
  * Wind proof
  * Water proof
  * Leg warmers

## Shoes

  * Cycle shoes &#8211; I clip in with SPD shoes and pedals.
  * Actual trainers &#8211; I&#8217;ve made the mistake of not packing these, and it meant I couldn&#8217;t do extended walks &#8211; I missed out on a fair few &#8216;cool&#8217; sights in America.
  * Flipflops/sandels for camp.

## Civilian Clothes

  * Pair of rip off out door trousers. So you can have shorts or trousers.
  * 2 T-shirts
  * 1 Jumper/Hoodie
  * 1 Down Jacket
  * 1 Cap and 1 Wooly Hat
  * Thermals
  * 2 pairs of boxers and socks

## Tech + Entertainment

I&#8217;ve been on tours where I had to keep in contact with work and do marking. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend taking an iPad, but that was the easiest way to keep up with work while not lugging round a laptop. Otherwise, the usual tech I pack include.

### Phone

With a good camera so you don&#8217;t need to take a spare one. Keep in contact with family, have maps, access to the world and podcasts, useful when lonely/lost.

### Kindle

Books! All the books without the weight.

### GPS

My Garmin sends my location when I&#8217;m riding so my family know I&#8217;m safe (it even send a text if I crash).  Add a heart rate monitor and have ALL THE STATS.

### Battery Pack

Keep your tech on battery saver mode, and with a 20,000 mAH battery you can stay connected for almost a week. 

### Bone Conduction Headphones

Lifesavers at the end of an 8 hour slog to camp. Music, podcasts, audiobooks, all useful when you reach a mental roadblock. I&#8217;ve got the [Aftershock](https://aftershokz.co.uk/products/titanium) Titanium. 

### Paper Maps

Useful for the broader perspective of where you are, great in the pub at the end of the day.

### Torches

Head torch and a lamp for your tent are VITAL.
