I started out as a science busker working with the BBC, before being thrown in at the deep end, developing some of the largest demonstrations seen on childen's television, and ending up in front of the camera a fair few times. While TV and radio are great, my passion is to mix science with art and see what happens. As a science-content producer I've been proud to work with the best in the business to help bring their both my and their ideas to life. 

Here are some of my recent projects.
