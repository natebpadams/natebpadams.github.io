    title: "Science Shows"
    excerpt: "I write and produce science shows, telling the story of research and fundamental science (with as much fire as I can get away with). I’ve performed at Science Festivals around the country, including the National Big Bang Fair and Cheltenham Science Festival, toured around the country with the BBC, and performed at festivals as diverse as Edinburgh and Shambala. If you’re looking for a narrative led show with added dramatic demos, I’m your person."

    excerpt: "I’m a dab hand with a clipboard, and can tell terrible dad jokes, and with these key skills I’ve hosted variety nights, keynotes, seminars and panel discussions. I’ve been teaching the dark art of science communication for many years (my favourite bits are narrative development and logistics)."

    excerpt: "I’ve done ‘science’ on CBBC (Marrying Mum and Dad, Absolute Genius with Dick and Dom, FOMO) and Sky, including Live outside broadcast, and worked behind the scenes as a consultant on programmes for the BBC (including CBEEBies, CBBC and BBC Learning), Sky and National Geographic. "

From appearing on telly, to touring the country, I’ve done science *live* pretty much everywhere – and have got a world record in there along the way. While I'm not currently looking for new work at this time (I have a new job, in a new country, during a pandemic etc etc), if you need science content producer, or a demo developed, email me, and if I can't help, then I probably know someone who can.

# Work and Clients

I’ve presented live for some top companies, bodies and charities including the following groups. I’m conscientious, and with extra skills in handling dangerous chemicals and goods, a dab hand at demo development and creative narrative led script writing.
